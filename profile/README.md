## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Decentralized WP (DWP for short) is a project to remove WordPress.org from the WordPress equation.

WordPress should allow for hosts to self-host updates, allowing for more efficient bandwidth usage and smoother WordPress experience for the end-user. WordPress.org being unavailable should not impact a hosted WordPress site.

Please file issues in https://github.com/decentralized-wp/issues for triage.
